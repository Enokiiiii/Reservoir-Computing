In this code, we predict reversal of large-scale circulation in turbulent convection by reservoir computing.

The function "run" is for the syncronization.
The function "train" is for the learning.
The function "pre" is for the prediction.

There are some hyperparameters, such as the number of node in reservoir "N", the spectral radius of the reservoir connection matrix "sr",
and the scale of the input connection matrix "b".
